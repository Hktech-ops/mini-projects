## Problem Statement:

Your company has its data centers in the East US offices connected via mesh
wide-area network links, with full connectivity between them. You need to implement a
lab environment that will reflect the topology of your company’s on-premises
networks and verify its functionality. I would like you to create and test the following:
● Provision the lab environment
● Configure local virtual network peering
● Test intersite connectivity
● Secure the virtual network with an NSG
